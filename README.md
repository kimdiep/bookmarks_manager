Bookmarks Manager
=================

## Project Overview

**To build a web app that stores web bookmarks in a database.**


- A bookmark manager is a website to maintain a collection of bookmarks (URLs). 
- You can use it to save a webpage you found useful. 
- You can add tags to the webpages you saved to find them later. 
- You can browse bookmarks other users have added. 
- You can comment on the bookmarks.


## For this project, we are targetting the following goals:

- Can you build a web app that uses a database?
- Agile and TDD
- Engineering and 'Dev Recipes'
- Databases
- Tooling

For the test-driven development, we will be using the **Behaviour Driven Development (BDD) cycle** (i.e. outside-in testing: Capybara first).
